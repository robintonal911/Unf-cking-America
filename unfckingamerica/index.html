                America’s very identity is in crisis. Politicians aren’t solving problems, oligopolies are arguably more
                powerful than ever, along with ever increasing rates of socio-economic inequality.
                Not only is the world’s most powerful country wavering in the face of new global superpowers, but its
                own people can’t afford homes and have been jaded and profoundly angered by the media and political
                system, bringing us to what feels like the brink of civil war.

                Beyond the issues themselves, mass media rarely explores the underlying explanations for this state of
                limbo we’re in, and in many ways, that wouldn’t be in its best interest, because it plays a big role in
                our being in it.

                    There’s this general growing anger, and there's really valid reasons for this. The whole country can feel it, and I think I speak
                    for most of us when I say that each of us feels that ball in our stomachs everytime we turn on the news or doomscroll through twitter. Getting triggered
                    has become the normal reaction to the never ending onslaught of injustice and lies we hear and see on our screens. That
                    anger is not only making the general state of the country worse – it’s making our individual lives
                    worse and less meaningful. <a class="meme2"> Anger can affect us in many ways </a>

                    Of all the different types of tweets that get promoted, anger based tweets tend to get much greater
                    algorithmic promotion(Milli, 2023): It’s not random that we get shown content that makes us angry, and
                    Twitter is definitrly the only media hub like this (I refuse to call it X). Many traditional news and media organizations have been
                    leaning into more polarizing and angering stances over the past few years for one specific reason:
                    it’s super profitable for them.

            <p class="introp" data-scroll data-scroll-speed="-2" data-scroll-class="appear" data-scroll-repeat="true">
                Anger greatly increases our stress levels and effectively short circuits our ability to think critically (Blair, 2011). In the
                context of social media, this means we engage more and spend more time on these services, where we'll see more ads and generate more ad dollars for these companies. They are literally financially incentivized to promote content that hijacks our brains, lining their pockets whilst actively dividing society in
                the process.
                And we can sit here <a class="meme2">waving our arms at the sky,</a>
                <img class="imgmeme" src="images/mancloud.jpeg" alt="">or we can think about the ways we can change
                things. We can’t these companies' business models, but what we can change is how we engage with them and
                react to their content.
            </p>

                To do so, we first need to understand the ways we as individuals can try to  reduce this externally inflicted anger. This can help us try to think more critically in times of ever-increasing societal
                non-discourse.

                confirm your beliefs, with the end of this logic leading people to have different understandings of what the truth is on any given topic.

                visual importance, yet each of those elements had fundamentally different goals. On TV, the same can be
                said: content goes from informational, to advertising, to fiction and cartoons all under the guise of
                entertainment. But contrary to social media, TV has historically put a lot of importance on the figure
                of the expert, used to disseminate empirically validated information. On social media, the user is not
                only a consumer of knowledge and information, but becomes a producer of one.

                This change in how knowledge is produced brought a great shift to how we consume information. The
                infinite amount of data available and its open accessibility to almost everyone leads to a situation
                where the expert’s perspectives aren’t seen as unequivocally true in the way they used to be (Malcolm,
                2021) due to equal access to informaintion . In addition to this, the persistent <a class="meme">manipulative use of the expert figure </a>

                This is part of the reason why our collective trust in experts has been eroded, enabling the prominence

                 (Malcolm, 2021).

                Because of the disagreement in what the truth actually is, the way we have conversations has also
                changed.
                In most debates, beyond trying to prove we’re right or trying to persuade the opposing side, many of us
                resort to anger, because no amount of talking will lead to any change in the way that people think. If
                it does, it’ll be in a very superficial way and would at best come in passing in a future conversation.

                Part of the reason why is that we have become a society of opinions.

                This shows us that opinion, contrary to a perspective, is a lot more like a belief – something that is
                irrational and profoundly based in emotion and identity, so it makes little to no sense to debate
                beliefs: There is a virtually non-existent chance that you will change someone’s mind on their beliefs.
                The tenants of human identity are founded in these beliefs, and they fuel our moral compass.

                But yet, when we try to have a conversation with one another, we ask each other what our opinions are.
                Not only that, most of social media is focused on pushing the user to either take a stance or double
                down on one we already have by feeding us more radical content each time:

                Therefore, opinion and truth get blended: opinions – which are a form of belief as explained earlier –

                situation (Malcolm, 2021). The consequences are that clan-like behavior becomes natural in such a
                context, and rationale and reason are for the most part forgotten, further amplifying anger and

                Mental frameworks are what drives us to feel and think a certain way. But every framework also has an

                Larger frameworks operate as funnels, and can go to great lengths to make themselves particularly
                attractive if they have a financial or power-based incentive behind them. In the case of America and the
                political process, there are many incentives that express themselves through a variety of ways, and on
                either side they are conducive to making the other side the enemy instead of focusing on what’s best for
                the people. Through this hatred, we stop actually considering people as people: Hate is the most

                From the start of this website, you were imposed a side. Throughout it, you were encouraged to
                antagonize the opposing side through your assumptions. In real life, the same thing happens, but aditionally this behaviour can be rewarded.
                We are not only encouraged to pick a side and attack the opposing side through example, but we are also
                rewarded socially through our filter bubbles. Instead of asking
                ourselves why we’re attacking, we’re doing so because we picked a side today, yesterday, years ago, as a
                child. That side isn’t only what we say we agree with. It’s who we are, and we’re going to stick to it, like a

                Although contrary to sports, politics is a lot more than a local community that irrationally vouches for their
                side, regardless of their chances against the opposition. It's about ideas, policies, and wealth
                distribution. It's the most powerful practice we know of, because it can dictate
                all other practices. Beyond the individual level, whatever your industry is, politics controls it in one way
                or another, so staying involved is super important. Our conversations and exchanges are being repeatedly highjacked by external actors to further their own collective agendas on both sides of the aisle. We are constantly debating beliefs, which isn't to say that isn't important or necessary, but it shouldn't be what we speak aout at all times.

                Ideas help us not only understand what we actually think on a given topic, but also help us perceive the deeper
                incentives behind the line being held. We are fed tons upon tons of information every day, and we simply
                don’t have the time to filter through and check various sources on a given topic, and it seems simpler
                to take our sources at face value because it is. Living in this current media climate means when surfing social media the individual ends up doing the journalist's job, checking sources, analyzing ideas provided, or if not they risk believing information that could serve incentives that are completely foreign to their own needs. Not only can we then get pushed in a specific direction, but we
                get progressively entrenched in the ideas and logics of that side, effectively closing our minds to other ideas.

                into these mindsets, because it helps both sides for you to hate the opposing side instead of question both: your side wins
                because they have someone that will vouch for them no matter what, and the opposing side has your hate
                as fuel to strengthen their own base in an emotional way. The Democratic and Republican parties want you
                to hate the opposite side.

                may feel that your side is out for your best interests, it isn’t: it's out for its leaders own best
                interest. Every time they can use emotion, they will do so to get you more invested in a more irrational
                way, using triggers to make you agree with ideas you might not actually morally align with. And also, it
                completely eliminates the desire for a third, or fourth political party, consolidating their power and
                removing the possibility of alternative solutions to those each side proposes.

                Now don’t get me wrong, we still need emotions in many ways – they're an essential part of how we construct our
                ideas and our identity, and are a fundamental component of dialogue – rather, we need to
                significantly reduce how much we rely on it. When we talk about politics, the question should never be
                'How do you feel about this?', but rather 'What do you think about this?'.

            </p>

            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="-1" data-scroll-class="appear" data-scroll-repeat="true">
                Instead of focusing on our emotional knee-jerk reaction, we can attempt to actually think about the
                ideas that we’re faced with and challenge them in a thought-out way, dissociated from our projected identity and centered on our personal moral compass. We can also try to understan if there are
                dissimulated motives behind those leading the conversation that we might not have paid attention to otherwise.
            </p>

            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="-2" data-scroll-class="appear" data-scroll-repeat="true">
                It also can actually enable you to see how much your moral values actually align with the side you feel
                closer to, and vice versa – are these ideas representative of how I lead my life? Of how I wish to lead my
                life? If we start to reason more than we react, we can become a lot more aware of the intentions of
                those with whom we agree, and also become more considerate of ideas and propositions from those we disagree with.
                Although that prospect might not seem attractive to you, these are people that hold the same power as
                you through their votes: If you just see them as another one of THEM, you’ll inevitably become, if you
                don't already feel such, cynical and jaded,
                just like everyone else. Does cynicism seem like a meaningful way for us to lead our lives? That’s for
                you to
                answer.

            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="-2" data-scroll-class="appear" data-scroll-repeat="true">
                My point is that through greater empathy, we can re-humanize those around us, that we’ve grown up with, that we live
                with, that we love. Finding that empathy is crucial in leading a more fulfilling life, and makes room for a more
                meaningful society that actually cares about creating a better world for its members, not just
                pretending it does.

                Hate can only do so much for our lives. We've been feeling it for a while, we've been in the heart of the eclipse for a long time. But the sun will come back at some point. Thinking about the information we ingest and the way we speak to
                each other is conducive
                in treating our fellow humans as such.
